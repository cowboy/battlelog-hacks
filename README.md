# Battlelog Hacks

EA's new Battlelog service is pretty awesome. Except when it isn't.

## Installation

[mainscript]: https://raw.github.com/cowboy/battlelog-hacks/master/dist/battlelog-hacks.js
[userscript]: https://raw.github.com/cowboy/battlelog-hacks/master/dist/battlelog-hacks.user.js

Click [this userscript][userscript], then click Ok/Continue/Install in any browser confirmation dialogs that pop up.

## Updating

Once the [userscript][userscript] has been installed, you should automatically see changes to the [main script file][mainscript] whenever it gets updated, just reload Battlelog to get the latest version.

## What does it do?

* Auto-retries server join so you don't have to spam the button. To cancel auto-retry, click the "Close" button in the Game Manager error popup.
* Remembers and auto-re-applies server browser sorting preference.
* Prevents the server browser from scrolling to the top of the page on refresh.

## What might it do in the future?

* Possibly other stuff related to server browsing / joining.

## Notes

* This is a work in progress.
* Lots of messages are logged to the console. Check it out.
* This is tested only in Chrome 14 with Battlefield 3.
* It works for me.
